# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

In this project we're going to find out what binary trees do,
some of their functions and use cases.

## 0. New node
function that creates a binary tree node
## 1. Insert left
function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
## 2. Insert right
function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
## 3. Delete
function that deletes an entire binary tree
## 4. Is leaf
function that checks if a node is a leaf
## 5. Is root
function that checks if a given node is a root
## 6. Pre-order traversal
function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
## 7. In-order traversal
function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
## 8. Post-order traversal
function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
## 9. Height
function that measures the height of a binary tree
## 10. Depth
function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
## 11. Size
function that measures the size of a binary tree
## 12. Leaves
function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
## 13. Nodes
function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
## 14. Balance factor
function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
## 15. Is full
function that checks if a binary tree is full
## 16. Is perfect
function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
## 17. Sibling
function that finds the sibling of a node
## 18. Uncle
function that finds the uncle of a node
